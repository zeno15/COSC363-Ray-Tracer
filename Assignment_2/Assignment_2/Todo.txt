############ Still to do ##############

Other primitives

	-	cone (1)
	-	tetrahedron (1)



spotlight (1)

refractions (1)



3d textures (1-2) (bump mapping?)


Others (1 - 5 on complexity)
	-	Acceleration algorithms (bounding volumes)
	-	advanced illumination models
	-	constructive solid geometry

############### Done ###################
Other primitives
	-	cube (NEEDED) 
	-	cylindar (1)
	-	torus (2) //~ Does not scale :(
camera motion
	-	Can move forward and back along view axis
	-	Can move perpinidicular (left and right) of view axis
	-	Can rotate on x-z plane +- 5 degrees
anti-aliasing
	-	supersampling (varies on x and z)
	-	adaptive
	-	stochastic
arbitary rotations of scene objects (2) (Need to add scale coping for new objects)
	-	rotation
	-	scale
	-	translation
textured plane
textured sphere (1)
multiple light sources (1)

MultiThreading (max 4 threads, thread 1 is run on the main thread), increase by 'o', decrease by 'l'

############### Questions ###################
	-	Shadows on the bottom of the plane
	-	Specular reflection on cube overpowers when facing light source
