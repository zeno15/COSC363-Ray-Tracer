############ Still to do ##############

Other primitives

	-	cone (1)
	-	cylindar (1)
	-	tetrahedron (1)
	-	torus (2)


multiple light sources (1)

spotlight (1)

refractions (1)

arbitary rotations of scene objects (2)
	-	scale

3d textures (1-2)

multithreading?

add in something that prints to the console the % done if it takes too long

Others (1 - 5 on complexity)
	-	Acceleration algorithms (bounding volumes)
	-	advanced illumination models
	-	participating media (fog, smoke)
		-	FAIL
	-	camera motion
		-	rotation
	-	constructive solid geometry

############### Done ###################
Other primitives
	-	cube (NEEDED)
camera motion
	-	linear movement
anti-aliasing
	-	supersampling (varies on x and z)
	-	adaptive
	-	stochastic
arbitary rotations of scene objects (2)
	-	rotation
	-	translation
textured plane
textured sphere (1)

############### Questions ###################
	-	Shadows on the bottom of the plane
	-	Specular reflection on cube overpowers when facing light source
	-	After scaling the normals only look as expected up close
	-	Shadows move when camera moves
